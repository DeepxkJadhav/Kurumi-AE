## ✦ Overview

<strong>Kurumi</strong> is not a desktop assistant, chatbot, or animated pet.  
She operates as a **background presence**, appearing and reacting based on environmental signals rather than direct user input.

The system prioritizes:
- autonomy over obedience  
- silence over noise  
- emergence over constant visibility
