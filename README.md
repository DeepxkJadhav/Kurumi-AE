## About

**Kurumi-AE** is an experimental desktop entity designed to exist quietly within the system environment.  
She is not a chatbot, not a virtual pet, and not a command-driven assistant.

Kurumi observes context, reacts selectively, and manifests only when conditions align.  
Silence is intentional. Presence is deliberate.

---

## Characteristics

- Transparent desktop overlay  
- Non-repetitive, state-driven behavior  
- Minimal user interaction  
- Optional voice output  
- Designed for atmosphere, not productivity  

---

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DeepxkJadhav/Kurumi-AE
cd Kurumi-AE
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py


Kurumi may not appear immediately.
This is expected.

---
```
## Status

Experimental project focused on behavioral realism and presentation quality.
